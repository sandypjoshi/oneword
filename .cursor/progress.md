## Known Issues

1. **Content Quality Variance**: Quality of generated content varies
   - Current mitigation: Improved prompts and examples
   - Status: To be reviewed after full processing
   - Next steps: Sample random words across difficulty levels for manual review

2. **Terminal Dashboard Compatibility**: Some terminal emulators may not display ANSI colors correctly
   - Current mitigation: Using basic color codes for maximum compatibility
   - Status: Working in standard terminals

3. **Frontend Performance**: Potential slowdowns with large dataset
   - Current mitigation: Not yet addressed
   - Status: To be evaluated during integration
