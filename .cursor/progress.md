## Known Issues

1. **Onboarding Navigation**: Sometimes navigation from onboarding to main app can show a brief flash
   - Current mitigation: Added Stack navigator with proper animations
   - Status: Mostly resolved, minor edge cases remain
   - Next steps: Further optimize transition timing

2. **Carousel Performance**: Potential performance issues with many cards in the FlatList
   - Current mitigation: Added optimization like getItemLayout and windowSize
   - Status: Currently working well with test data
   - Next steps: Test with full dataset from Supabase

3. **Content Quality Variance**: Quality of generated content varies
   - Current mitigation: Improved prompts and examples
   - Status: To be reviewed after full processing
   - Next steps: Sample random words across difficulty levels for manual review

4. **Terminal Dashboard Compatibility**: Some terminal emulators may not display ANSI colors correctly
   - Current mitigation: Using basic color codes for maximum compatibility
   - Status: Working in standard terminals
