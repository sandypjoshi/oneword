# OneWord - Project Progress

## Completed Features

### Word Enrichment Infrastructure
- âœ… Database integration with Supabase
- âœ… Batch processing system for word enrichment
- âœ… Multi-API key rotation with rate limit handling
- âœ… Definition generation using Gemini API
- âœ… OWAD phrase generation using Gemini API
- âœ… Distractor generation using Gemini API
- âœ… Terminal-based dashboard for monitoring and control
- âœ… Error handling and recovery for API requests
- âœ… Selective processing of only unprocessed words

### Content Generation
- âœ… Short definitions generation
- âœ… OWAD-style phrase pairs generation
- âœ… Semantic, antonym, and form-based distractors generation

## In Progress Features

### Content Generation
- ðŸ”„ Processing ~64,500 words (definitions, OWAD phrases, distractors)
  - Started: March 16, 2024
  - Estimated completion: ~7-8 hours from start

### Monitoring & Quality Control
- ðŸ”„ Real-time progress tracking
- ðŸ”„ API usage optimization

## Planned Features

### Quality Assurance
- ðŸ“‹ Quality review of generated content
- ðŸ“‹ Content refinement for improved quality
- ðŸ“‹ Consistency checks across related word forms

### Frontend Integration
- ðŸ“‹ Display generated definitions in UI
- ðŸ“‹ Format and present OWAD phrases
- ðŸ“‹ Implement distractor selection in quizzes

## Known Issues

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Occasional rate limit errors despite safeguards
   - Current mitigation: Key rotation and exponential backoff
   - Status: Being monitored

2. **Content Quality Variance**: Quality of generated content varies
   - Current mitigation: Improved prompts and examples
   - Status: To be reviewed after full processing

3. **Terminal Dashboard Compatibility**: Some terminal emulators may not display ANSI colors correctly
   - Current mitigation: Using basic color codes for maximum compatibility
   - Status: Working in standard terminals

## Statistics

- Total words in database: ~68,760
- Words remaining for processing: ~64,500
- Words processed: ~4,260
- Current processing rate: ~300-400 words/hour (with 5 API keys)
- API requests per word: ~3 (definition, OWAD phrases, distractors)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API rate limits | High | Medium | Multiple API keys, rate limiting, backoff strategy |
| Content quality issues | Medium | Medium | Quality review, prompt refinement |
| Processing time overruns | Low | Low | Optimized batch processing, parallel API usage |
| Data loss | High | Low | Regular progress tracking, resume capability |
