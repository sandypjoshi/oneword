# OneWord - Active Context

## Current Focus
Quality review and integration of completed word enrichment data including definitions, OWAD phrases, and distractors.

## Recent Changes
- **March 17, 2025**: Completed full reprocessing of all words with improved content generation
  - Successfully processed 68,759 out of 68,760 words (99.999%)
  - Enhanced error handling with retry logic and batch size reduction
  - Implemented API key masking and environment variable configuration
  - Added robust checkpoint system for resumable processing
  - Improved OWAD phrase generator to maintain part of speech
  - Enhanced distractors for better semantic distinction

- **March 16, 2025**: Created a new reliable dashboard and optimized word enrichment process
  - Rewrote dashboard.js from scratch using ANSI colors instead of blessed/blessed-contrib
  - Modified database queries to only process words that need enrichment
  - Optimized API key rotation to efficiently use 5 keys in parallel
  - Improved error handling for API responses
  - Added detailed statistics and progress tracking

- **March 15, 2025**: Implemented multi-key rotation system 
  - Added support for 5 API keys with rotation
  - Created configuration for optimal API usage respecting rate limits
  - Implemented batch processing with optimized settings

## Current Status

- Updated 65,204 definitions (94.8%), 68,276 OWAD phrases (99.3%), and 68,465 distractors (99.6%)
- All content ready for frontend integration and quality review

## Next Steps
1. **Quality Review**: Review a sample of generated content for quality control
2. **Content Refinement**: Make any necessary adjustments to generators for improved content quality
3. **Frontend Integration**: Ensure generated content is properly displayed in the application frontend
4. **Testing**: Test the application with the newly generated content
5. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and optimize any performance bottlenecks

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring consistent quality across large volumes of generated content
- Optimizing frontend performance with the large dataset
- Developing efficient testing methodology for content quality

## Technical Decisions
- Moving from hardcoded API keys to environment variables for security
- Including .cursor in Git repository for better project continuity
- Enhancing error handling and recovery mechanisms for reliability
- Using SQL-level filtering to optimize processing
