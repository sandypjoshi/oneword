# OneWord - Active Context

## Current Focus
Optimizing the word enrichment process for definitions, OWAD phrases, and distractors using the Gemini API.

## Recent Changes
- **March 16, 2024**: Created a new reliable dashboard and optimized word enrichment process
  - Rewrote dashboard.js from scratch using ANSI colors instead of blessed/blessed-contrib
  - Modified database queries to only process words that need enrichment
  - Optimized API key rotation to efficiently use 5 keys in parallel
  - Improved error handling for API responses
  - Added detailed statistics and progress tracking

- **March 15, 2024**: Implemented multi-key rotation system 
  - Added support for 5 API keys with rotation
  - Created configuration for optimal API usage respecting rate limits
  - Implemented batch processing with optimized settings

## Current Status
- Processing ~64,500 words that need definitions, OWAD phrases, and distractors
- Using 5 API keys in rotation to maximize throughput
- Dashboard provides real-time progress monitoring and control

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Enrichment Process**: Allow the current process to complete for all words
2. **Quality Review**: Review a sample of generated content for quality control
3. **Content Refinement**: Make any necessary adjustments to generators for improved content quality
4. **Performance Analysis**: Analyze usage patterns of API keys and adjust rate limits if needed
5. **Frontend Integration**: Ensure generated content is properly displayed in the application frontend

## Current Challenges
- Monitoring long-running process efficiently
- Handling potential API rate limiting issues
- Ensuring consistent quality across large volumes of generated content

## Technical Decisions
- Using simple, reliable ANSI-based dashboard instead of complex UI libraries
- Implementing keyboard controls for process management
- Focusing on error resilience through improved error handling
- Using SQL-level filtering to skip already processed words
