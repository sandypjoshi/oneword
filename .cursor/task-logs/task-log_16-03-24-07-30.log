GOAL: Improve Word Enrichment Process and Dashboard

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Fixed data retrieval to only process unprocessed words (words missing definitions, OWAD phrases, or distractors)
2. Optimized API key rotation to efficiently use 5 API keys in parallel
3. Enhanced error handling for JSON parsing errors and API request failures
4. Created a reliable ANSI-based dashboard to replace the problematic blessed/blessed-contrib implementation
5. Improved console feedback with detailed statistics and color-coded information
6. Added keyboard controls for process management (start/stop/restart)
7. Implemented real-time monitoring of:
   - Processing progress and rate
   - API key usage statistics
   - Estimated completion time
   - Current word being processed
8. Optimized batch processing settings (batch size, delays, rate limits) for maximum efficiency

Key improvements:
- Accurate tracking of unprocessed words (64,000+ out of 68,000+ total)
- Significantly increased processing speed through parallel API key usage
- Better error resilience through improved error handling
- More accessible monitoring through simple terminal-based dashboard
- Clear visualization of processing statistics and progress
