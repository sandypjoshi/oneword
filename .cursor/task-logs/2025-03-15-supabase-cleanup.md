# Supabase Functions and Migrations Cleanup - March 15, 2025

## Task Summary
Removed all outdated Supabase functions and migrations, treating the project as new without the historical baggage of obsolete components.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Supabase Functions Cleanup
- Removed all function implementations from `supabase/functions/`
- Preserved only the basic structure with the `_shared` directory
- Cleaned up the following functions:
  - `calculate-word-difficulty`
  - `check-words-quality`
  - `daily-word-assignment`
  - `datamuse-enrichment`
  - `debug-word-counts`
  - `enrich-words`
  - `generate-distractors`
  - `get_schema_info`
  - `run-database-function`
  - `select-daily-words`

### 2. Migrations Cleanup
- Removed all migration files from `supabase/migrations/`
- Removed migration backups from `supabase/migrations.backup/`
- Created an empty `supabase/migrations/` directory for future use
- Removed `lib/supabase/migrations.sql` from the project

### 3. Edge Functions Cleanup
- Removed edge function implementation files from `lib/supabase/edgeFunctions/`
- Cleared implementations of:
  - `addWordForNextDay.ts`
  - `seedWordsForDateRange.ts`
- Retained empty `edgeFunctions` directory for future development

### 4. Backup
- All removed files are backed up in the `oneword-backup-20250315` directory:
  - Supabase functions: `oneword-backup-20250315/supabase-functions-backup/`
  - Edge functions: `oneword-backup-20250315/lib-backup/edgeFunctions/`
  - Migrations: `oneword-backup-20250315/lib-backup/migrations.sql`

## Results
- Project is now clean of outdated Supabase functions and migrations
- Removed technical debt from old implementations
- Ready for fresh implementation of functions and migrations as needed
- Streamlined codebase with focus on current requirements
- Maintained backup of all removed components for reference if needed
