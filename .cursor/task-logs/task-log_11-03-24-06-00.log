GOAL: Set up the Cursor Memory Bank system for the OneWord project to maintain context between sessions.

IMPLEMENTATION: 
1. Created the core Memory Bank files in the .cursor/context/ directory:
   - projectbrief.md: Core requirements and goals of the OneWord project
   - productContext.md: Why the project exists and how it should work
   - systemPatterns.md: System architecture and key technical decisions
   - techContext.md: Technologies used and technical constraints
   - activeContext.md: Current work focus and recent changes
   - progress.md: What works, what's left to build, and known issues

2. Created an implementation plan in the .cursor/plans/ directory:
   - oneword-implementation-plan.md: Detailed plan with architecture, implementation phases, and dependencies

3. Created a task log in the .cursor/task-logs/ directory to document this setup process

4. Analyzed the project by:
   - Examining the existing file structure
   - Reading the project documentation in the docs/ directory
   - Checking the database schema and tables
   - Understanding the current implementation status
