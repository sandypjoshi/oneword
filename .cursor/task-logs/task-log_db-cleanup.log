GOAL: Clean up and optimize the OneWord database by removing unused tables, consolidating views, and ensuring a more maintainable schema.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Removed the unused 'complete_word_view' view
2. Created a consolidated 'word_relationships' view that replaces four separate relationship views
3. Dropped individual relationship views (word_synonyms, word_antonyms, word_hypernyms, word_hyponyms)
4. Dropped trigger 'update_app_word_distractors_timestamp' from the app_word_distractors table
5. Dropped the function 'update_app_word_distractors_updated_at()' 
6. Removed 'word_metadata_word_fkey' constraint from the word_metadata table
7. Dropped empty tables 'word_metadata' and 'app_word_distractors'
8. Created a backup of 'word_normalization_map' table and then dropped the original table

The cleanup was implemented through a series of SQL commands executed manually through the Supabase SQL editor.
