- DON'T USE placeholder for API Keys, USE keys you have or ask user.
- User supabase CLI and curl to interact with our database when needed. If it fails, ask user to make changes manually on Supabase dashboard.
- Follow latest documentation of supabase
- When using MCP for database operations, exercise extreme caution with destructive actions. Always confirm with the user before executing DELETE, DROP or any data-removing operations.
- Before bulk operations through MCP, show a sample of affected records and get explicit approval.
- Ask before using MCP's direct table operations.
