# OneWord Project Memo

## Project Overview
OneWord is a vocabulary learning application that helps users expand their vocabulary through interactive word games, challenges, and educational content. The app presents users with new words, their definitions, and pronunciation, along with contextual examples and quizzes to reinforce learning.

## Architecture
- React Native (Expo) for cross-platform mobile development
- Supabase for backend database and authentication
- Custom design system with tokens for consistent styling

## Key Design Patterns

### Component Structure
- Atomic design approach (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Component composition over inheritance
- Controlled components with clear prop interfaces

### State Management
- Context API for global state (theme, user preferences)
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Async storage for persistent data

### Styling Approach
- Design token system as single source of truth
- Theme-based styling with light/dark mode support
- Responsive layout using flexbox patterns
- Semantic color tokens for consistent theming
- Two theme options: Default and Quill, each with light/dark modes

### Animation Patterns
- Declarative animations using Animated API
- Consistent timing and easing functions via tokens
- Progressive feedback for user interactions

## Current Focus
- Implementing a comprehensive testing strategy
- Enhancing documentation and JSDoc comments
- Improving API error handling in service layers
- Transitioning from mock data to real API implementations
- Improving UI component contrast and accessibility
- Ensuring consistent loading states across components

## Code Conventions
- Typescript for type safety
- Functional components with hooks
- Component files structured by feature
- Consistent naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for components
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - UPPER_CASE for constants

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for UI logic
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Snapshot tests for UI components
- Accessibility testing for all interactive elements

## Audit Findings (March 2024)
A comprehensive code audit verified compliance with project rules and standards, with the following insights:

### Strengths
- Strong adherence to design system with consistent token usage
- Well-structured components with proper TypeScript typing
- Good component organization and file structure
- Proper implementation of accessibility features in UI components
- Effective use of React hooks and performance optimization techniques

### Areas for Improvement
- Need for comprehensive testing implementation
- Enhanced documentation to improve code maintainability
- More robust error handling in service layers
- Transition from mock data to real API endpoints
- Consistent loading state implementation across components

## Priority Action Items
1. Implement Jest testing configuration and component tests
2. Standardize JSDoc comments across codebase
3. Develop robust error handling for API services
4. Replace mock services with real API implementations
5. Create consistent loading and error state components
