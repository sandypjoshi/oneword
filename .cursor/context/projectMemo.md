# OneWord Project Memo

## Project Overview
OneWord is a vocabulary learning application that helps users expand their vocabulary through interactive word games, challenges, and educational content. The app presents users with new words, their definitions, and pronunciation, along with contextual examples and quizzes to reinforce learning.

## Architecture
- React Native (Expo) for cross-platform mobile development
- Supabase for backend database and authentication
- Custom design system with tokens for consistent styling

## Key Design Patterns

### Component Structure
- Atomic design approach (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Component composition over inheritance
- Controlled components with clear prop interfaces

### State Management
- Context API for global state (theme, user preferences)
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Async storage for persistent data

### Styling Approach
- Design token system as single source of truth
- Theme-based styling with light/dark mode support
- Responsive layout using flexbox patterns
- Semantic color tokens for consistent theming
- Two theme options: Default and Quill, each with light/dark modes

### Animation Patterns
- Declarative animations using Animated API
- Consistent timing and easing functions via tokens
- Progressive feedback for user interactions

## Current Focus
- Implementing a comprehensive testing strategy
- Enhancing documentation and JSDoc comments
- Improving API error handling in service layers
- Transitioning from mock data to real API implementations
- Improving UI component contrast and accessibility
- Ensuring consistent loading states across components

## Code Conventions
- Typescript for type safety
- Functional components with hooks
- Component files structured by feature
- Consistent naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for components
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - UPPER_CASE for constants

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for UI logic
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Snapshot tests for UI components
- Accessibility testing for all interactive elements

## Audit Findings (March 2024)
A comprehensive code audit verified compliance with project rules and standards, with the following insights:

### Strengths
- Strong adherence to design system with consistent token usage
- Well-structured components with proper TypeScript typing
- Good component organization and file structure
- Proper implementation of accessibility features in UI components
- Effective use of React hooks and performance optimization techniques

### Areas for Improvement
- Need for comprehensive testing implementation
- Enhanced documentation to improve code maintainability
- More robust error handling in service layers
- Transition from mock data to real API endpoints
- Consistent loading state implementation across components

## Priority Action Items
1. Implement Jest testing configuration and component tests
2. Standardize JSDoc comments across codebase
3. Develop robust error handling for API services
4. Replace mock services with real API implementations
5. Create consistent loading and error state components 

## Current Status

### Recent Accomplishments

### Active Development
- ðŸ”„ Implementing paper-like noise texture overlay for gradients
- ðŸ”„ Creating reusable MeshGradient background component
- ðŸ”„ Exploring animation options for subtle gradient movement
- ðŸ”„ Updating documentation for new visual components
- ðŸ”„ Refining word suggestion algorithm for daily practice

### Key Priorities
1. Complete the mesh gradient implementation with noise texture
2. Create a reusable gradient background component for any screen
3. Finalize word difficulty level balancing
4. Implement enhanced word suggestion algorithm

## Technical Highlights

### Visual Component Enhancements
The MeshGradientCard component has been significantly enhanced with:
- Performance optimizations using React.memo and proper hook usage
- Expanded color palette system with 27 nature-inspired combinations
- Elegant inner border styling with theme-based opacity
- Planned paper-like noise texture overlay using Skia shaders

This implementation provides a foundation for consistent visual styling across the app with optimized performance.

### Status Bar Fixes
Resolved a persistent dark mode issue on iOS where the status bar text was appearing dark on dark backgrounds:
- Updated UIStatusBarStyle in Info.plist to UIStatusBarStyleLightContent
- Added StatusBar component to tab layout for consistent appearance
- Ensured proper handling of color scheme changes

### Performance Optimizations
Recent performance enhancements include:
- Proper memoization strategies for complex components
- Optimized gradient rendering for better battery life
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders through careful component design

## Next Major Milestones

### Visual System Completion (Target: 1 week)
- Complete paper-like noise texture overlay
- Create reusable gradient background component
- Document usage patterns and performance considerations

### Word Difficulty Balancing (Target: 2 weeks)
- Finalize algorithm for difficulty calculation
- Balance word distribution across difficulty levels
- Implement user feedback mechanism for difficulty adjustment

### User Testing Phase (Target: 3 weeks)
- Prepare testing scenarios for core user journeys
- Identify key metrics for measuring user satisfaction
- Create feedback collection mechanism

## Known Issues and Risks

### Technical Debt
- Need comprehensive testing strategy for visual components
- Animation performance on lower-end devices requires optimization
- Text contrast on some gradient combinations may need adjustment

### Resource Constraints
- Limited design resources for creating comprehensive guidelines
- Testing capacity across diverse device range

## General Notes
The work on visual components represents a significant enhancement to the app's aesthetic quality while maintaining performance. The MeshGradientCard implementation provides a foundation for consistent visual styling across the app.
