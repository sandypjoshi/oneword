# OneWord Project Memo

## Project Overview
OneWord is a vocabulary learning application that helps users expand their vocabulary through interactive word games, challenges, and educational content. The app presents users with new words, their definitions, and pronunciation, along with contextual examples and quizzes to reinforce learning.

## Architecture
- React Native (Expo) for cross-platform mobile development (New Architecture enabled)
- Supabase for backend database and authentication (**Production database deployed and ready**)
- Zustand for state management
- Custom design system with tokens for consistent styling
- AI-first content generation with Gemini 2.5 Pro structured output

## Key Design Patterns

### Component Structure
- Atomic design approach (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Component composition over inheritance
- Controlled components with clear prop interfaces

### State Management
- Zustand for managing application state (word data, card interactions, user progress)
- Context API used primarily for ThemeProvider
- Async storage for persisting theme preferences and user progress (via Zustand middleware)

### Styling Approach
- Design token system (colors, typography, spacing) as single source of truth
- Theme-based styling (`ThemeProvider`, `useTheme` hook) with light/dark modes and multiple themes (Default, Quill)
- Foundational layout components (`Box`, `Text` (Enhanced)) integrate directly with theme tokens via props
- Reusable UI components (`Separator` (New), `Chip`, `Icon`, etc.)
- Responsive layout using flexbox patterns (via `Box` component)
- Semantic color tokens for consistent theming

### Animation Patterns
- Reanimated for performant UI animations (e.g., card flip)
- Animated API (used in `ThemeProvider` transition, potentially elsewhere)
- Consistent timing and easing functions via tokens (Potential: verify if animation tokens exist)
- Progressive feedback for user interactions (e.g., Haptics)

### Animation State Management
- Using refs and store state for persistent animations

## Current Focus
- **Backend API Development:** Building services using completed database infrastructure
- **Content Generation Revolution:** AI-first vocabulary curation with Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Frontend Integration:** Connecting React Native app to production Supabase backend
- **Sprint Acceleration:** Leveraging 2-day schedule advantage for parallel development

## Code Conventions
- Typescript for type safety
- Functional components with hooks
- Component files structured by feature
- Consistent naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for components
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - UPPER_CASE for constants

## Testing Strategy (Planned)
- Unit tests for utility functions, hooks, stores.
- Component tests (React Native Testing Library) for UI logic.
- Integration tests for key user flows.
- End-to-end tests (potentially using Maestro or Detox) for critical user journeys.
- Snapshot tests for UI components.
- Accessibility testing for all interactive elements.

## Audit Findings (March 2024)
A comprehensive code audit verified compliance with project rules and standards, with the following insights:

### Strengths
- Strong adherence to design system with consistent token usage
- Well-structured components with proper TypeScript typing
- Good component organization and file structure
- Proper implementation of accessibility features in UI components
- Effective use of React hooks and performance optimization techniques

### Areas for Improvement
- Need for comprehensive testing implementation
- Enhanced documentation to improve code maintainability
- More robust error handling in service layers
- Transition from mock data to real API endpoints
- Consistent loading state implementation across components
