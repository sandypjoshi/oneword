9. **Quality Review**: Review a sample of generated content for quality control
10. **Content Refinement**: Make any necessary adjustments to generators for improved content quality

## Current Challenges
- Balancing rich UI animations with performance on lower-end devices
- Ensuring consistent behavior across iOS and Android platforms
- Efficiently integrating backend data with the frontend
- Ensuring consistent UI across different devices and screen sizes
- Ensuring consistent quality across large volumes of generated content
- Optimizing frontend performance with the large dataset

## Technical Decisions

- Using FlashList instead of FlatList for better performance with large datasets
- Adding clear documentation in code for critical components to prevent future regressions
- Implementing a root Stack navigator for proper screen transitions
- Using AppState tracking to properly handle system theme changes
- Implementing a useThemeReady hook for consistent theme loading
- Using consistent styling patterns across screens
- Enhancing theme context with safety checks and default values
- Moving from hardcoded API keys to environment variables for security
- Including .cursor in Git repository for better project continuity
- Enhancing error handling and recovery mechanisms for reliability
- Using SQL-level filtering to optimize processing
