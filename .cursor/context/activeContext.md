# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Theme system refinement and UI component contrast improvements
- Ensuring proper use of semantic color tokens throughout the app
- Simplifying the theme system by removing unused themes

## Recent Changes
### UI Component Contrast Enhancement (2024-03-22)
1. **Issue Resolved**: Improved contrast for OptionButton components in the Quill theme
   - Root cause: Background color too similar to surrounding content
   - Impact: Buttons were hard to distinguish in the Quill theme

2. **Key Implementation Changes**:
   - Modified OptionButton to use `background.active` for light mode instead of `background.tertiary`
   - Updated text color to use `text.secondary` for better contrast
   - Added hairline border to default state buttons for better visual definition
   - Fixed component to properly handle color schemes

3. **Theme System Simplification**:
   - Removed the unused Aura theme completely from the codebase
   - Updated ThemeName types across the system to only include 'default' and 'quill'
   - Simplified theme mapping in colors.ts and typography.ts

### Typography System Fix (2024-03-19)
1. **Issue Resolved**: Fixed critical issue with button text styling not respecting typography tokens
   - Root cause: Incorrect access of typography styles in Text component
   - Impact: Button text was inconsistent across the app

2. **Key Implementation Changes**:
   - Fixed Text component's access to theme typography styles
   - Removed hardcoded values and special cases
   - Properly utilizing variant system for consistent styling

3. **Design System Guidelines**:
   - Always use typography tokens through the variant system
   - Never bypass design tokens with hardcoded values
   - Follow the proper style chain: tokens → theme → component

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**:
   - Audit semantic color token usage in all components
   - Ensure consistent use of token naming across themes
   - Consider converting direct palette references to semantic token references

2. **Technical Debt**:
   - Review components for color contrast across all themes
   - Implement responsive design adjustments for better accessibility

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update component documentation with token usage examples
   - Add guidelines for managing semantic tokens vs. palette colors

## Known Issues
- Some direct palette references exist where semantic tokens would be more appropriate
- Need to verify consistent token naming across themes
