# Active Context - OneWord Project

## Current Focus
Database optimization and maintenance to ensure a clean, efficient, and maintainable database structure.

## Recent Changes

### Database Cleanup (Completed)
- Removed unused views and consolidated multiple semantic relationship views into a single, more flexible view
- Dropped empty tables that weren't serving any purpose (app_word_distractors, word_metadata)
- Removed redundant triggers and functions
- Created a backup of the word_normalization_map table before removing it
- The new consolidated word_relationships view provides a more consistent interface for querying word relationships

### Database Structure
The optimized database now consists of:
- **Core Tables**: words, app_words, synsets, word_synsets, word_examples, and supporting tables
- **Views**: daily_word_details, word_definitions, word_relationships, word_with_examples

## Next Steps
1. **Document the updated database schema** - Update documentation to reflect the new database structure and relationships
2. **Verify application functionality** - Ensure all app features still work with the consolidated relationship view
3. **Consider indexing strategy** - Review and optimize database indexes for the most common query patterns
4. **Update any application code** - Modify any code that was using the removed views to use the new consolidated view instead
