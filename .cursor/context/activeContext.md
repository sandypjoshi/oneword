   - Transition from mock data to real API endpoints
   - Consistent loading state implementation across components

### UI Component Contrast Enhancement (2024-03-22)
1. **Issue Resolved**: Improved contrast for OptionButton components in the Quill theme
   - Root cause: Background color too similar to surrounding content
   - Impact: Buttons were hard to distinguish in the Quill theme

2. **Key Implementation Changes**:
   - Modified OptionButton to use `background.active` for light mode instead of `background.tertiary`
   - Updated text color to use `text.secondary` for better contrast
   - Added hairline border to default state buttons for better visual definition
   - Fixed component to properly handle color schemes

3. **Theme System Simplification**:
   - Removed the unused Aura theme completely from the codebase
   - Updated ThemeName types across the system to only include 'default' and 'quill'
   - Simplified theme mapping in colors.ts and typography.ts

### Typography System Fix (2024-03-19)
1. **Issue Resolved**: Fixed critical issue with button text styling not respecting typography tokens
   - Root cause: Incorrect access of typography styles in Text component
   - Impact: Button text was inconsistent across the app

2. **Key Implementation Changes**:
   - Fixed Text component's access to theme typography styles
   - Removed hardcoded values and special cases
   - Properly utilizing variant system for consistent styling

3. **Design System Guidelines**:
   - Always use typography tokens through the variant system
   - Never bypass design tokens with hardcoded values
   - Follow the proper style chain: tokens → theme → component

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**:
   - Test gesture handling implementation across different devices
   - Monitor for any other potential gesture conflicts in the app
   - Verify the swipe fix resolves the crashing issue completely
   - Consider applying similar touch protection to other interactive components

2. **Technical Debt**:
   - Audit semantic color token usage in all components
   - Review components for color contrast across all themes
   - Implement responsive design adjustments for better accessibility
   - Review gesture handling throughout the app for potential conflicts

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update component documentation with token usage examples
   - Document the new touch handling approach for future reference
   - Add guidelines for managing semantic tokens vs. palette colors
   - Document testing strategy and best practices

## Known Issues
- Some direct palette references exist where semantic tokens would be more appropriate
- Need for comprehensive test suite for components and services
- Mock data services need to be replaced with real API implementations
- Inconsistent loading state handling across components
- Need to verify consistent token naming across themes

### Current Focus: Improving Gesture Handling in Card Interactions

#### Enhanced Swipe Gesture Handling Fix (Implemented)

**Root Cause:** App crashes and accidental button taps during card swiping were caused by conflicting gesture handlers. A time-based approach to block interactions was not sufficient to prevent all accidental taps.

**Key Changes:**
- Enhanced the `OptionButton` component with a `PanResponder` to properly detect and handle swipe gestures
- Implemented a robust movement tracking system that distinguishes between taps and swipes
- Removed the previous time-based touch tracking from `WordCardQuestion` component
- Added a small delay to button actions to prevent accidental taps
- The solution properly respects the parent's gesture handling while ensuring that accidental taps don't trigger during swipes

**Strategy:**
1. The `PanResponder` in `OptionButton` now tracks the start of touch interactions
2. If the touch moves more than a small threshold (10px), it's considered a swipe and the press is canceled
3. Only registers a tap if the movement is minimal (less than threshold)
4. A small delay (100ms) is added before triggering the press, giving time to detect swipes
5. The `WordCardQuestion` component was simplified by removing its touch tracking logic

This implementation provides a more robust solution by handling the gesture detection at the button level rather than relying on timing-based detection at the card level.

#### Previous Swipe Crash Fix (Implemented)

**Root Cause:** App crashes during card swipes were found to be caused by two issues:

1. Import path issue in `WordCardQuestion.tsx` (importing from wrong path)
2. Conflict between the gesture handler and FlashList scroll handling

**Key Changes:**
- Fixed the import path for `useTheme` from `../../theme/ThemeProvider` to `../../theme`
- Implemented a lightweight touch tracking system that avoids interfering with the parent scrolling
- The solution avoids potential crashes while still preventing accidental button taps during swipes

#### Codebase Standards Audit (In Progress)

The audit has identified several areas for improvement:

**Strong Areas:**
- UI component organization follows design tokens and theme system
- Accessibility features like contrast, scaling, and semantic markup
- Clean separation of concerns in component architecture

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Test coverage is minimal, particularly for critical user journeys
- Error handling needs enhancement in network operations
- Component documentation needs improvement in some areas

#### UI Component Contrast Enhancement (Completed)

Improved contrast in OptionButton component for better accessibility, particularly for dark mode users.

### Next Steps

1. Complete documentation updates for the gesture handling solution
2. Implement automated tests for the word card components
3. Monitor user feedback to ensure the swipe gesture fix resolves all edge cases

### Known Issues

1. Card animations may stutter on older devices during rapid interactions
2. Text-to-speech occasionally fails on certain Android devices
