## Current Status

### Phase 1: Core Linguistic Data Enrichment
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Achievements**:
  - Processed 212,000+ words from WordNet
  - Collected frequency data for eligible words
  - Gathered syllable counts for eligible words
  - Classified words based on eligibility criteria

### Phase 2: Difficulty Calculation & Scoring
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS (85% complete)
- **Achievements**:
  - Implemented multi-factor difficulty calculation
  - Created configurable weighting system
  - Processed initial set of words (2,000)
  - Defined difficulty bands
  - Created configurable difficulty threshold system
  - Implemented admin tools for threshold management
- **Remaining Work**:
  - Complete scoring for all eligible words
  - Validate algorithm against expert ratings
  - Analyze word distribution across difficulty levels

### Phase 3: Distractor Generation
- **Status**: PLANNING
- **Achievements**:
  - Designed distractor generation strategies
  - Created initial database structure
- **Remaining Work**:
  - Implement generation algorithms
  - Create batch processing system
  - Build storage and retrieval mechanisms

### Phase 4: Advanced Educational Features
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Planned Work**:
  - Design user progress tracking
  - Implement adaptive learning features
  - Create enhanced quiz formats

## Known Issues

### Data Quality
1. **Incomplete Definitions**: Some WordNet definitions lack clarity or context
   - **Impact**: May affect user understanding
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize words with complete definitions for daily selection

2. **Missing Examples**: Approximately 15% of words lack usage examples
   - **Impact**: Reduced learning context for some words
   - **Mitigation**: Generate examples using AI for words missing examples

3. **Inconsistent Part of Speech**: Some words have multiple conflicting POS tags
   - **Impact**: May cause confusion in word presentation
   - **Mitigation**: Standardize POS tags based on primary usage

### Technical Issues
1. **Batch Processing Performance**: Large batch processing is slow
   - **Impact**: Delays in completing full dataset processing
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize scripts and use smaller batch sizes

2. **API Rate Limiting**: Datamuse API has usage limits
   - **Impact**: Slows down enrichment process
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching and rate limiting in scripts

3. **Database Query Performance**: Some complex queries are slow
   - **Impact**: May affect app responsiveness
   - **Mitigation**: Create optimized views and add indexes

## Next Milestones

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- Complete difficulty scoring for all eligible words
- Implement and test word selection algorithm
- Create database views for efficient word retrieval
- Begin implementation of distractor generation system
- Fine-tune difficulty thresholds based on word distribution analysis

- Add profile and settings functionality
- Prepare for beta testing

# OneWord Project Progress

## Recently Completed Features

### Application Compatibility
- üîÑ Updating application code to use the new word_relationships view instead of individual relationship views
- üîÑ Verifying that all application features work correctly with the updated database structure

### Performance Optimization
- üîÑ Reviewing database query patterns to identify potential indexing needs
- üîÑ Analyzing query performance with the new consolidated view structure

## Planned Features

### Database Documentation
- üìã Update comprehensive database documentation to reflect the new structure
- üìã Document the word_relationships view usage and query patterns

### Database Maintenance
- üìã Implement regular database health check procedures
- üìã Create scripts to monitor and maintain database performance

## Known Issues

### Potential Application Compatibility
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Code that directly referenced the individual relationship views (word_synonyms, word_antonyms, etc.) will need to be updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The word_relationships view may return more records than the individual views did (needs verification)

### Database Structure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some foreign key constraints are implied through string-based joins rather than enforced by the database schema
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Database lacks explicit documentation of the synchronization mechanism between words and app_words tables
