- ⚠️ The word_relationships view may return more records than the individual views did (needs verification)

### Database Structure
- ⚠️ Some foreign key constraints are implied through string-based joins rather than enforced by the database schema
- ⚠️ Database lacks explicit documentation of the synchronization mechanism between words and app_words tables
