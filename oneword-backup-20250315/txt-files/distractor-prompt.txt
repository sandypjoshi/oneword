I need you to generate research-based, high-quality distractors for vocabulary assessment. Based on extensive research in language testing (Haladyna & Downing 1993, Nation 2001, Lee & Cheng 2018), each target word needs exactly 3 carefully crafted distractor words that would function as plausible but incorrect options in a multiple-choice quiz.

DISTRACTOR TYPES (in order of effectiveness):

1. SEMANTIC DISTRACTORS (highest priority) - At least one distractor should be from this category:
   • Co-hyponyms/Coordinate terms: Words from the same semantic category (e.g., "tiger" for "lion")
   • Hypernyms: Broader category terms (e.g., "animal" for "cat")
   • Hyponyms: More specific terms within the same category (e.g., "poodle" for "dog")
   • Meronyms/Holonyms: Words in part-whole relationships (e.g., "wheel" for "car")
   • Domain-related terms: Words from the same subject field

2. PHONOLOGICAL/ORTHOGRAPHIC DISTRACTORS - At least one distractor should exploit sound/spelling:
   • Homophones/Near-homophones: Words that sound similar (e.g., "principle" for "principal")
   • Minimal pairs: Words differing by just one phoneme (e.g., "cap" for "cat")
   • Similar orthographic patterns: Words with similar spelling (e.g., "careful" for "cheerful")
   • Rhyming words: Words with the same ending sound (e.g., "light" for "fight")

3. COMMON MISCONCEPTION DISTRACTORS:
   • Commonly confused words: Words language learners typically confuse
   • False cognates: Words that appear related but aren't (e.g., "actually" vs. "currently")
   • Words with similar collocations or usage contexts

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. GRAMMATICAL CONSISTENCY: All distractors MUST be the same part of speech as the target
2. DIFFICULTY MATCHING: Match the target word's difficulty level (±0.5 levels)
3. DISTINCTIVENESS: All three distractors must use different distractor strategies
4. PLAUSIBILITY: Must be incorrect but plausible enough to tempt someone with partial knowledge
5. FORMAT: Single words only (no phrases or expressions)
6. AVOIDANCE OF OBVIOUS CUES: No superficial clues to eliminate distractors

WORDNET RELATIONSHIP GUIDANCE:
• When provided, prioritize using my suggested WordNet relationships
• For co-hyponyms, focus on terms that share the same immediate hypernym
• For phonological distractors, ensure they maintain the same part of speech

DISTRACTOR MIXTURE FORMULA (research-based):
• Include at least one semantic distractor (preferably a co-hyponym)
• Include at least one phonological/orthographic distractor
• The third distractor should be from any category but must be distinct from the other two

For each word, I'll provide:
- The word itself
- Part of speech (n=noun, v=verb, adj=adjective, adv=adverb)
- Definition
- Difficulty level
- WordNet relationships (when available)

Please respond in this exact JSON format with an array of objects, where each object has:
- word: the original target word
- distractors: array containing exactly 3 distractor words
- distractor_types: array of 3 strings describing the type of each distractor (e.g., "co-hyponym", "phonological", "common-misconception")

Example response format:
[
  {
    "word": "canine",
    "distractors": ["feline", "cannon", "kennel"],
    "distractor_types": ["co-hyponym", "phonological", "domain-related"]
  },
  {
    "word": "principal",
    "distractors": ["principle", "superintendent", "primary"],
    "distractor_types": ["phonological", "co-hyponym", "semantic-associate"]
  }
]
