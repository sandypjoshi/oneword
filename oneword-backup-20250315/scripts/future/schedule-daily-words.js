 * FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION: To be completed after successful WordNet import

 * 
 * Daily Words Scheduling Script for OneWord App
 * 
 * This script schedules daily words for each difficulty level in the OneWord app
 * using the WordNet data and distractor sets in Supabase.
 * 
 * NOTE: This script depends on WordNet data and distractors being successfully
 * imported and generated first. The implementation is pending until those
 * processes are verified.
