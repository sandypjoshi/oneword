# OneWord Project Cleanup Summary

## Date: March 15, 2025

This document summarizes the cleanup activities performed on the OneWord project to streamline the codebase and remove unnecessary files and directories.

## Overview of Actions Taken

1. Created a comprehensive backup directory (`oneword-backup-20250315`) containing all removed files
2. Removed non-essential scripts, test files, and temporary data files
3. Updated the README.md with current project information
4. Verified that the application still works after cleanup

## Backup Created

All removed files were backed up in the following structure:
- `oneword-backup-20250315/`
  - `js-files/`: JavaScript files (non-essential)
  - `scripts/`: One-time scripts and utilities
  - `tests/`: Test files and test-related utilities
  - `sql-files/`: SQL scripts and migrations
  - `json-files/`: JSON data files
  - `logs/`: Log files
  - `html-files/`: HTML files
  - `csv-files/`: CSV data files
  - `txt-files/`: Text files
  - `md-files/`: Markdown files (except README.md)
  - `wordnet-data/`: WordNet data files
  - `datasets/`: Additional data sets
  - `word_datasets/`: Word-related datasets
  - `mcp-supabase/`: MCP Supabase files
  - `supabase/`: Non-essential Supabase files

## Retained Project Structure

The following structure was retained as the essential project components:

```

├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

## NPM Scripts Status

The following NPM scripts are available to run the project:
- `npm start`: Start the Expo development server
- `npm run ios`: Start the app on iOS
- `npm run android`: Start the app on Android
- `npm run web`: Start the app on web

## Verification

The application was successfully started after cleanup, indicating that all essential files were properly retained.

## Next Steps

1. Consider removing any remaining non-essential NPM scripts from package.json
2. Update dependencies to their expected versions as noted during startup
3. Further refine the application code as needed
4. Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Note

If any essential files were inadvertently removed during the cleanup process, they can be retrieved from the backup directory.
