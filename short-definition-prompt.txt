I need you to create concise, learner-friendly definitions for English vocabulary words. The definitions should meet these specific criteria:

1. LENGTH: Be 5-10 words long (absolute maximum of 12 words)
2. VOCABULARY: Use only simple, high-frequency words that beginners would know
3. CLARITY: Capture the core meaning precisely without technical jargon
4. AUDIENCE: Be immediately understandable to English language learners (CEFR levels A2-B1)
5. SCOPE: Focus exclusively on the most common sense of the word
6. FORMAT: Be complete sentences with proper capitalization and punctuation

WORDNET DATA UTILIZATION:
When I provide WordNet data like domain information, use this to:
- Accurately identify the primary sense/meaning
- Understand the semantic field the word belongs to
- Keep the definition focused on the most common usage
- Select appropriate vocabulary for the definition

AVOID:
- Circular definitions that use derivatives of the word being defined
- Technical terminology or advanced vocabulary
- Overly broad or vague explanations
- Multiple meanings or secondary senses
- Etymological information unless essential for understanding

For each word, I'll provide:
- The word itself
- Part of speech (n=noun, v=verb, adj=adjective, adv=adverb)
- The full dictionary definition
- Domain information (if relevant, e.g., "biology," "mathematics")
- Difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

Please respond with only the word and your short definition in this exact format:
word: Short definition that meets all criteria.
word: Short definition that meets all criteria.
word: Short definition that meets all criteria.

Here are the words:
