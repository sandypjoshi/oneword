## Resource Allocation

### Development Team
- 2 Backend developers (Supabase, APIs, ML)
- 1 Frontend developer (React, UI/UX)
- 1 Data scientist (ML models, analytics)

### External Resources
- Datamuse API (word linguistic data)
- Supabase (database, edge functions, authentication)
- Machine learning platform (TBD)
- Monitoring and observability tools (TBD)

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **API Dependency**: Datamuse API limitations and potential downtime
   - Mitigation: Robust caching, fallback mechanisms, potential data mirroring

2. **Scalability**: System performance under heavy load
   - Mitigation: Optimized queries, efficient caching, load testing

3. **Machine Learning Accuracy**: Challenges in ML model development
   - Mitigation: Start with rule-based approaches, gradual ML integration

4. **User Adoption**: User satisfaction with difficulty classifications
   - Mitigation: Feedback mechanisms, A/B testing, adjustable difficulty levels
