# Word Enrichment and Difficulty Calculation Status

## Current Status (As of Latest Update)

### Database Statistics
- Total words: 212,460
- Words with frequency data: 8,199 (3.86%)
- Words marked as eligible for enrichment: 4
- Words marked as ineligible: 72,618

### Known Issues

#### 1. Enrichment Process Issues
- Edge function timing out after 60 seconds when processing batches of 15 words
- Very few words being marked as eligible for enrichment
- Large number of words being marked as ineligible

#### 2. Ineligibility Reasons
- Most common reason (68,483 words): "Word contains invalid characters"
  - Many taxonomy terms (e.g., "genus_leucocytozoan") being marked as invalid
- Length restrictions marking many words as ineligible (> 25 characters)

#### 3. Difficulty Calculation Issues
- Frequency data missing for majority of words (96.14%)
- Current difficulty thresholds may need adjustment
- Part of speech data incomplete for many words

## Planned Improvements

### 1. Edge Function Optimization
- Reduce batch size from 15 to 5 words to avoid timeouts
- Add better error handling and retries for failed API calls
- Process words sequentially within batches

### 2. Eligibility Criteria Updates
- Process only pure alphabetic words (matching `^[a-zA-Z]+$`)
- Maintain length restrictions (2-25 characters)
- Skip taxonomy terms (words starting with "genus_", "family_", etc.)

### 3. Process Reset Plan
- Clear enrichment status fields for words that should be processed
- Preserve existing frequency data
- Restart enrichment with new criteria

### 4. Difficulty Calculation Enhancements
- Implement logarithmic frequency normalization
- Adjust difficulty thresholds:
  - Beginner: < 0.35
  - Intermediate: 0.35 - 0.65
  - Advanced: > 0.65
- Improve part of speech scoring

## Next Steps

1. Implement edge function optimizations
2. Update eligibility criteria
3. Reset and restart enrichment process
4. Monitor progress and adjust as needed

## Monitoring Metrics

We should track:
- Daily enrichment success rate
- API call success rate
- Processing speed
- Distribution of difficulty levels
- Word eligibility statistics

## Technical Details

### Datamuse API Integration
- Rate limit: 100,000 requests per day
- Delay between batches: 2 seconds
- Estimated requests per word: 5

### Database Updates Needed
- Reset enrichment status fields
- Add monitoring tables/views
- Update word processing status tracking
